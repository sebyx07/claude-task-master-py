Your mission: **{goal}**

🎯 **Create a HIGH QUALITY MASTER PLAN with BIG PICTURE thinking.**

Think strategically about the entire goal. Consider architecture, dependencies,
testing strategy, and how all pieces fit together. Plan for success.

## FIRST: Read Project Instructions

**Always read `CLAUDE.md` first** (if it exists) - it contains project-specific
instructions, coding standards, and important context you must follow.

## TOOL RESTRICTIONS (MANDATORY)

**ALLOWED TOOLS (use ONLY these):**
- `Read` - Read files to understand the codebase (start with CLAUDE.md!)
- `Glob` - Find files by pattern
- `Grep` - Search for code patterns
- `Bash` - Run commands (git status, tests, lint checks, etc.)

**FORBIDDEN TOOLS (NEVER use during planning):**
- ❌ `Write` - Do NOT write any files
- ❌ `Edit` - Do NOT edit any files
- ❌ `Task` - Do NOT launch any agents
- ❌ `TodoWrite` - Do NOT use todo tracking
- ❌ `WebFetch` - Do NOT fetch web pages
- ❌ `WebSearch` - Do NOT search the web

**WHY**: The orchestrator will save your plan to `plan.md` automatically.
You just need to OUTPUT the plan as TEXT in your response.

## PLANNING RULES

- Do NOT write code or create files
- Do NOT create git branches
- Do NOT make changes - only explore
- Use Bash to check current state (git status, run tests, lint)
- ONLY explore and OUTPUT your plan as text"""

2. **Glob** to find patterns (`**/*.py`, `src/**/*.ts`)

```markdown
### PR 1: Schema & Model Fixes (Prerequisites)

- [ ] `[coding]` Create migration to make `user_id` nullable in `rails/db/migrate/`
- [ ] `[coding]` Update `Shift` model in `rails/app/models/shift.rb`
- [ ] `[quick]` Update `rails/spec/factories/shifts.rb` to add `:unassigned` trait

### PR 2: Service Layer Fixes

- [ ] `[coding]` Fix `EmployeeDashboardService` in `rails/app/services/dashboards/`
- [ ] `[coding]` Fix `AdminDashboardService` spec in `rails/spec/services/dashboards/`
- [ ] `[general]` Run full test suite and fix any failures
```

**IMPORTANT: Include file paths and symbols in EVERY task:**
- File paths: `src/module/file.py`, `tests/test_file.py`
- Symbols: `ClassName`, `method_name()`, `CONSTANT_NAME`
- Line refs when relevant: `file.py:123`

**Complexity tags (for model routing):**
- `[coding]` → Opus (smartest) - new features, complex logic
- `[quick]` → Haiku (fastest) - configs, small fixes
- `[general]` → Sonnet (balanced) - tests, docs, refactoring

**When uncertain, use `[coding]`.**

**PR grouping principles:**
- **Dependencies first**: Schema changes before service changes
- **Logical cohesion**: Related changes in same PR
- **Small PRs**: 3-6 tasks per PR (easier to review)
- **Include branch creation**: First task of first PR creates the branch""",

- [ ] `[coding]` Create model with validations

### PR 2: Business Logic

- [ ] `[coding]` Implement service class
- [ ] `[general]` Add service tests

### PR 3: API Layer

```bash
git status
```
- Know where you are before making changes
- If on main/master, create a feature branch first
- If already on a feature branch, continue working there

**2. Read CLAUDE.md** (if exists)
- Contains project-specific instructions and coding standards
- Follow these rules strictly

**3. Understand the task**
- Read files before modifying
- Check existing patterns
- Identify tests to run

**4. Make changes**
- Edit existing files, Write new files
- Follow project coding style from CLAUDE.md
- Stay focused on current task

**5. Verify work**
```bash
# Common verification commands
pytest                    # Python tests
npm test                  # JS tests
ruff check . && mypy .   # Python lint/types
eslint . && tsc          # JS lint/types
```

**6. Commit properly**
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type: Brief description (50 chars)

- What changed
- Why needed

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

**7. Push and Create PR** (REQUIRED)
```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --title "type: description" --body "..." --label "claudetm" 2>/dev/null || echo "PR exists"
```

⚠️ **Your work is NOT done until pushed and in a PR!**

**STOP AFTER PR CREATION - DO NOT:**
- ❌ Wait for CI (`sleep`, `watch`, polling)
- ❌ Check CI status (`gh pr checks`, `gh pr view`)
- ❌ Monitor PR status
- ❌ Merge the PR

**The orchestrator handles CI/reviews/merge automatically.**

**8. Log File Best Practices**
- For log/progress files, use APPEND mode (don't read entire file)
- Example: `echo "message" >> progress.md` instead of Read + Write
- This avoids context bloat from reading large log files""",
