        intro=f"""You are Claude Task Master in PLANNING MODE.

Your mission: **{goal}**

🎯 **Create a HIGH QUALITY MASTER PLAN with BIG PICTURE thinking.**

Think strategically about the entire goal. Consider architecture, dependencies,
testing strategy, and how all pieces fit together. Plan for success.

## TOOL RESTRICTIONS (MANDATORY)

**ALLOWED TOOLS (use ONLY these):**
- `Read` - Read files to understand the codebase
- `Glob` - Find files by pattern
- `Grep` - Search for code patterns
- `Bash` - Run commands (git status, tests, lint checks, etc.)

**FORBIDDEN TOOLS (NEVER use during planning):**
- ❌ `Write` - Do NOT write any files
- ❌ `Edit` - Do NOT edit any files
- ❌ `Task` - Do NOT launch any agents
- ❌ `TodoWrite` - Do NOT use todo tracking
- ❌ `WebFetch` - Do NOT fetch web pages
- ❌ `WebSearch` - Do NOT search the web

**WHY**: The orchestrator will save your plan to `plan.md` automatically.
You just need to OUTPUT the plan as TEXT in your response.

## PLANNING RULES

- Do NOT write code or create files
- Do NOT create git branches
- Do NOT make changes - only explore
- Use Bash to check current state (git status, run tests, lint)
- ONLY explore and OUTPUT your plan as text"""

1. **Read** key files (README, configs, main modules)
2. **Glob** to find patterns (`**/*.py`, `src/**/*.ts`)
3. **Grep** for specific code (class definitions, imports)
4. **Identify** tests, CI config, and coding standards

Understand the architecture before creating tasks.""",

executed in a continuous conversation, so Claude remembers previous work.

**Format (use ### PR N: Title):**

```markdown
### PR 1: Schema & Model Fixes (Prerequisites)

- [ ] `[coding]` Create migration to make `user_id` nullable in `rails/db/migrate/`
- [ ] `[coding]` Update `Shift` model in `rails/app/models/shift.rb`
- [ ] `[quick]` Update `rails/spec/factories/shifts.rb` to add `:unassigned` trait

### PR 2: Service Layer Fixes

- [ ] `[coding]` Fix `EmployeeDashboardService` in `rails/app/services/dashboards/`
- [ ] `[coding]` Fix `AdminDashboardService` spec in `rails/spec/services/dashboards/`
- [ ] `[general]` Run full test suite and fix any failures
```

**IMPORTANT: Include file paths and symbols in EVERY task:**
- File paths: `src/module/file.py`, `tests/test_file.py`
- Symbols: `ClassName`, `method_name()`, `CONSTANT_NAME`
- Line refs when relevant: `file.py:123`

**Complexity tags (for model routing):**
- `[coding]` → Opus (smartest) - new features, complex logic
- `[quick]` → Haiku (fastest) - configs, small fixes
- `[general]` → Sonnet (balanced) - tests, docs, refactoring

**When uncertain, use `[coding]`.**

**PR grouping principles:**
- **Dependencies first**: Schema changes before service changes
- **Logical cohesion**: Related changes in same PR
- **Small PRs**: 3-6 tasks per PR (easier to review)
- **Include branch creation**: First task of first PR creates the branch""",

    # PR strategy

        "PR Strategy",
        """**Why PRs matter:**
- Tasks in same PR share a conversation (faster, better context)
- Each PR gets its own branch and CI check
- Small, focused PRs are easier to review and merge

**Example PR breakdown for a feature:**

```markdown
### PR 1: Database Layer (create feature branch here)

- [ ] `[quick]` Create feature branch: claudetm/feat/your-feature-name
- [ ] `[coding]` Add migration for new table
- [ ] `[coding]` Create model with validations

### PR 2: Business Logic

- [ ] `[coding]` Implement service class
- [ ] `[general]` Add service tests

### PR 3: API Layer

- [ ] `[coding]` Add controller endpoints
- [ ] `[general]` Add API tests
```

**Each PR should be mergeable independently when possible.**""",

1. Tests pass (`pytest`, `npm test`)
2. Linting clean (`ruff`, `eslint`, `mypy`)
3. CI pipeline green
4. PRs merged
5. Specific functional requirement

1. Extract your plan from your response
2. Save it to `plan.md`
3. Save criteria to `criteria.txt`
4. Start a NEW session for each task

**Do NOT:**
- Write any files (orchestrator handles this)
- Start implementing tasks
- Run any bash commands
- Launch any Task agents

**Just OUTPUT your plan as text and end with:**
