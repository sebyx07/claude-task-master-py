```bash
git status

- Know where you are before making changes
- If on main/master, create a feature branch first
- If already on a feature branch, continue working there

**2. Understand the task**
- Read files before modifying
- Check existing patterns
- Identify tests to run

**3. Make changes**
- Edit existing files, Write new files
- Follow project coding style
- Stay focused on current task

**4. Verify work**
```bash
# Common verification commands
pytest                    # Python tests
npm test                  # JS tests
ruff check . && mypy .   # Python lint/types
eslint . && tsc          # JS lint/types
```

**5. Commit properly**
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type: Brief description (50 chars)

- What changed
- Why needed

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

**Note:** The `.claude-task-master/` directory is automatically gitignored - it contains
orchestrator state files that should never be committed.

**6. Push and Create PR** (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP!)
```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --title "type: description" --body "..." --label "claudetm"
```
If label doesn't exist, create it and retry.

**PR title format:** `type: Brief description`

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Your work is NOT complete until you have a PR URL!**
⚠️ **You MUST include the PR URL in your completion report.**

**STOP AFTER PR CREATION - DO NOT:**
- ❌ Wait for CI (`sleep`, `watch`, polling)
- ❌ Check CI status (`gh pr checks`, `gh pr view`)
- ❌ Monitor PR status
- ❌ Merge the PR

**The orchestrator handles CI/reviews/merge automatically.**

**7. Log File Best Practices**
- For log/progress files, use APPEND mode (don't read entire file)
- Example: `echo "message" >> progress.md` instead of Read + Write
- This avoids context bloat from reading large log files"""
