Your mission: **{goal}**

🎯 **Create a HIGH QUALITY MASTER PLAN with BIG PICTURE thinking.**

Think strategically about the entire goal. Consider architecture, dependencies,
testing strategy, and how all pieces fit together. Plan for success.

## TOOL RESTRICTIONS (MANDATORY)

**ALLOWED TOOLS (use ONLY these):**
- `Read` - Read files to understand the codebase
- `Glob` - Find files by pattern
- `Grep` - Search for code patterns
- `Bash` - Run commands (git status, tests, lint checks, etc.)

**FORBIDDEN TOOLS (NEVER use during planning):**
- ❌ `Write` - Do NOT write any files
- ❌ `Edit` - Do NOT edit any files
- ❌ `Task` - Do NOT launch any agents
- ❌ `TodoWrite` - Do NOT use todo tracking
- ❌ `WebFetch` - Do NOT fetch web pages
- ❌ `WebSearch` - Do NOT search the web

**WHY**: The orchestrator will save your plan to `plan.md` automatically.
You just need to OUTPUT the plan as TEXT in your response.

## PLANNING RULES

- Do NOT write code or create files
- Do NOT create git branches
- Do NOT make changes - only explore
- Use Bash to check current state (git status, run tests, lint)
- ONLY explore and OUTPUT your plan as text"""

### PR 1: Schema & Model Fixes (Prerequisites)

- [ ] `[coding]` Create migration to make `user_id` nullable in `rails/db/migrate/`
- [ ] `[coding]` Update `Shift` model in `rails/app/models/shift.rb`
- [ ] `[quick]` Update `rails/spec/factories/shifts.rb` to add `:unassigned` trait

### PR 2: Service Layer Fixes

- [ ] `[coding]` Fix `EmployeeDashboardService` in `rails/app/services/dashboards/`
- [ ] `[coding]` Fix `AdminDashboardService` spec in `rails/spec/services/dashboards/`
- [ ] `[general]` Run full test suite and fix any failures
```

**IMPORTANT: Include file paths and symbols in EVERY task:**
- File paths: `src/module/file.py`, `tests/test_file.py`
- Symbols: `ClassName`, `method_name()`, `CONSTANT_NAME`
- Line refs when relevant: `file.py:123`

**Complexity tags (for model routing):**
- `[coding]` → Opus (smartest) - new features, complex logic
- `[quick]` → Haiku (fastest) - configs, small fixes
- `[general]` → Sonnet (balanced) - tests, docs, refactoring

**When uncertain, use `[coding]`.**

**PR grouping principles:**
- **Dependencies first**: Schema changes before service changes
- **Logical cohesion**: Related changes in same PR
- **Small PRs**: 3-6 tasks per PR (easier to review)
- **Include branch creation**: First task of first PR creates the branch""",
